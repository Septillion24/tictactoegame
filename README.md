# Tic Tac Toe in C#
This is a little tic-tac-toe game that I worked on to get used to C# again before I worked on other projects.

## Input
You will be prompted for each player to move. Input two numbers, either separated by a comma or period or not. For example:
> 22
> 2,2
> 2.2
> (2,2)
All of the above are valid inputs to place your marker at the bottom right of the screen
Coordinates always start at 0.
